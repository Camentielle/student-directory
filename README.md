# Student Directory

Simple terminal based student directory.

## Overview

The goal of this tutorial is to learn the process of creating a project on Ruby from scratch.

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.
